Phoenix:
<My name is Phoenix Wright.> <Here's the story:> <My first case is a fairly simple one.> <A young woman was killed in her apartment.> <The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her:>
[Load Butz_Thumbs]
<Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school.>  <Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it's usually the Butz.">
[Load Butz_Cry]
<In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true.> <He has a knack for getting himself in trouble.> <One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck.>
[Fade out Butz_Cry]
<But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart.> <That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name.>  <And that's just what I'm going to do!>
